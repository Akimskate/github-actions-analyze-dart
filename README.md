# GitHub Action â€” Analyze Flutter

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) allows you to leverage GitHub Actions to analyze your Flutter project's Dart code.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#common-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

- `fail-on-warnings`: The action fails if any warning was found. This will always fail on errors. Optional. Default: `false`
- `working-directory`: The working directory. Optional. Default: `./`

### Outputs
None.

### Common workflow

1. Your workflow must install Flutter before using this action. Suggestion: [Flutter action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flutter-action).
2. Use the action. For example:
```yaml
on: push

name: Sample Workflow

jobs:
  build:
    name: Example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
      - run: flutter pub get
      - name: Analyze Flutter
        use: zgosalvez/github-actions-analyze-flutter@v1
```
